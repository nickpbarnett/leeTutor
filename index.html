  <h1>English Language & Literature Tutor</h1> 
  <p>Qualified Secondary School Teacher with over 15 years in the classroom.</p> 
  <p>Key Stage 3, GCSE and 'A' Level.</p>
  <i>Shrewsbury, Shropshire, UK.</i>

      <h2>About me</h2>
      <h4>With 18 years classroom teaching experience, consistently judged ‘Outstanding’, I have helped many students to achieve excellent results at KS3, GCSE and Advanced Level over the course of my career.</h4><br>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-8">
      <p>I am an English specialist and have taught both Language and Literature to A level standard. I am also familiar with the new 9-1 GCSE courses and have experience of delivering the new specifications. During my years spent working as an Advanced Skills Teacher, I gained experience of preparing students for KS3 SATs, and school entrance tests. I have worked both with  ‘Academically More Able’ students and children with varying learning difficulties, taking particular pleasure when a student suddenly finds they can access a complex piece of literature or when a love of English is genuinely fostered.</p>

      <p>I have always been able to develop excellent relationships with the students I have taught and consider myself able to deliver key concepts and skills clearly and with enthusiasm, promoting understanding and confidence.</p>

      <p>I am pleased to offer highly structured and personalised tutoring. Whether you need to target specific skills in order to improve your general grasp of English or to receive more tailored, exam-driven support, I believe I can help students achieve their full potential.</p>

      <p>Limited spaces available for individual tuition or paired/group teaching, at a discounted rate.</p>

        <h4>"Lee is a superb tutor and we are so thankful for all she has done for our daughter. 
          She is like a different child! Reports from her teachers at the start of Year 11 suggested 
          that she was lacking confidence and would struggle to achieve a Grade 4 but, with Lee's help, 
          she got a 6! She is over the moon and so are we!"</h4>
      </div>

      <div class="item">
        <h4>"I cannot thank Lee enough for all the fantastic tuition she has given my son. From the moment 
          we met her, we were struck by how warm and friendly she was and because of this, it was easy to 
          persuade my son that extra help would benefit him. Over the course of the year, she built up an 
          excellent rapport with him and made it so fun for him to learn, he really enjoyed attending her 
          lessons. As a parent, I was impressed at her desire to liaise with his school English teacher in 
          order to achieve the best result for him- something that worked really well. I can't rate her 
          services highly enough!"</h4>
      </div>

      <div class="item">
        <h4>"We tried two other English tutors in the Shrewsbury area before approaching Lee and, straight 
          away the difference was clear. Not only does she have an impressive knowledge of the English 
          specifications, but was able to teach the skills needed in a way that my daughter really understood. 
          Her English teacher couldn't believe the change in her confidence in such a short space of time and 
          her eventual grade was two higher than she thought she would get."</h4>
      </div>

      <div class="item">
        <h4>"I would have no hesitation in recommending Lee to anyone looking to help their child improve their 
          English GCSE result. Lee came highly recommended from a teacher friend and she has worked wonders with 
          my son. Her experience in the classroom is clear to see and her friendly, patient and humorous approach 
          kept him focussed when others had tried and failed."</h4>
      </div>

      <div class="item">
        <h4>"I cannot thank Lee enough for all the help and support she gave me when I was working towards my GCSES 
          and I still miss seeing her every week. Not only were the lessons fun, but I felt that she was genuinely 
          interested in seeing me achieve the very best I could. Nothing was too much trouble and she was always on 
          the end of a phone to offer advice when I was feeling that I couldn't succeed. I did though, and it enabled 
          me to get a place on the college course I was desperate to do."</h4>
      </div>

      <div class="item">
        <h4>"My son's severe dyslexia meant that he has never found school a very positive experience and this only 
          got worse around his GCSEs as he felt more and more aware of his difficulties. Before he had one- to -one 
          tuition, he only managed to complete half of the exam paper before running out of time. Lee was terrific 
          with him in equipping him with some useful tools and strategies to ensure that he got everything down he 
          wanted to say in the time allowed. It is clear that she has lots of experience in teaching children with 
          specific educational needs because my son said that for the first time ever, he didn't feel like he had 
          one."</h4>
      </div>
      
      <div class="item">
        <h4>"My son has a range of special educational and emotional needs and Lee was absolutely the right choice of
          tutor for him as, not only did she improve his understanding of areas where he was struggling, she made
          his confidence soar. Unusually for the majority of our son's teachers, she also 'clicked ' with him straight
          away. Lee only tutored our son for a short time but it was enough to have a huge impact on how he
          approached his GCSE examinations. She is clearly very knowledgeable about the workings of the exam
          itself, but the way she focussed on creating an individualised learning programme for our son was second
          to none."</h4>
